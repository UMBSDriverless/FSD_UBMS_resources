Welcome to FSD UniBO Motorsport resources

Start here to study and know the basics of:

   * [Robotics](https://github.com/UMBSDriverless/FSD_UBMS_resources/wiki/Robotics): Technology and methods of development and system orchestration, design and architecture choices.
   * [Machine learning](https://github.com/UMBSDriverless/FSD_UBMS_resources/wiki/Machine-Learning): RL and supervised techniques, algorithms and useful libraries.
   * [Autonomous driving](https://github.com/UMBSDriverless/FSD_UBMS_resources/wiki/Autonomous-driving): requirements, design techniques and methods.

(TODO: expand with sensor processing, machine vision and embedded programming)
